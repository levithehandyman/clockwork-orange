# its a pomodoro clock.

if you dont know what that is, youre not alone. mostly its just a way to time your work so you can take a break now and then. or crush a high intensity workout for a 2 minute session followed by a one minute break. try it out!

try it, fork it, npm stuff applies. you are smart, you can figure it out!
